# splashshell shell integration for PowerShell (pwsh.exe / powershell.exe)
# Injects OSC 633 escape sequences for command lifecycle tracking.
# Uses [char] escapes for compatibility with Windows PowerShell 5.1.
#
# Event sequence (for both AI-initiated and user-typed commands):
#   OSC B (Enter pressed) → PSReadLine AcceptLine finalize →
#   OSC C (command about to execute) → command output →
#   OSC D;{exitCode} (command finished) → OSC P;Cwd=... → OSC A (prompt ready) →
#   prompt text rendered → PSReadLine input loop (prediction, etc.)
#
# splash captures just the region between OSC C and OSC D as the command
# output. Bytes outside that window (typing animation, AcceptLine finalize,
# prompt repaint, PSReadLine prediction) are ignored, so no heuristic
# "strip up to first newline" logic is needed.
