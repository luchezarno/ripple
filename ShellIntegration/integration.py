# splash Python REPL integration — installs OSC 633 emission into sys.ps1
# so splash can track command boundaries the same way it does for pwsh / bash.
#
# Event sequence per command (after the first prompt):
#   >>> user types something → Enter →
#   Python reads + compiles + execs the statement →
#   output is written to stdout →
#   Python re-renders the prompt by calling str(sys.ps1) →
#   our __str__ returns "OSC D;0  OSC P;Cwd=...  OSC A  >>> " →
#   splash's OscParser sees the markers and resolves the command.
#
# No OSC B / OSC C — Python has no stdlib-level pre-input hook, and we
# paper over the missing "command started" marker by having the worker
# call SkipCommandStartMarker (same trick used for cmd.exe which has the
# same limitation). Input echo is stripped deterministically from the
# captured window using the byte-match strategy.
#
# Exit codes: Python REPL has no per-expression exit code, so OSC D
# always carries 0. Exceptions print a traceback to stderr but the
# prompt still comes back, which is how splash detects completion.
